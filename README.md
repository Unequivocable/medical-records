# FS1030_GroupC

Hi there!

As always, first run "npm install" to install all of the dependancies.

'npm start' will launch the React frontend on port 3000 and the Express backend on port 4000.

The site needs to access a MySQL database named 'emr_group_c'.  See the scratchpad_db.sql file in the database folder for full details of what is configured to connect.
